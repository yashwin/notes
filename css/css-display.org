CSS *display* property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

There are different properties for setting the display of an element:

    *inline*  displays an element as an *inline* element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect

    *block*  displays an element as a *block* element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width

    *contents*  makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the
        DOM

    *flex*  displays an element as a *block-level flex container*

    *grid*	displays an element as a *block-level grid container*

    *inline-block*	displays an element as an *inline-level block container*. The element itself is formatted as an inline
        element, but you can apply height and width values

    *inline-flex*	displays an element as an *inline-level flex container*

    *inline-grid*	displays an element as an *inline-level grid container*

    *inline-table*	the element is displayed as an *inline-level table*

    *list-item*  the element will behave like a *<li>* element

    *run-in*  displays an element as either block or inline, depending on context

    *table*	 the element will behave ike a *<table>* element

    *table-caption*	 the element will behave like a *<caption>* element

    *table-cell*  the element will behave like a *<td>* element

    *table-column*	the element will behave like a *<col>* element

    *table-row*	 the element behave like a *<tr>* element
