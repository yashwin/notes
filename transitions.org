CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.


Some older browsers need specific prefixes (-webkit-) to understand the transition properties:

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  -webkit-transition: width 2s; /* Safari prior 6.1 */
  transition: width 2s;
}

Using transitions:

Specify property to affect and how long transition lasts

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  transition: width 2s;
}


transition

	basic (can put everything in this one)

transition-delay

	specifies delay in seconds for transition

transition-duration

	specifies duration for transition

transition-property

	specifies property to change for transition

transition-timing-function

	With this you can also specify speed curves/easing:

	ease - transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
	linear - transition effect with the same speed from start to end
	ease-in - transition effect with a slow start
	ease-out - transition effect with a slow end
	ease-in-out - transition effect with a slow start and end

	Examples:

	{transition-timing-function: linear;}
	{transition-timing-function: ease;}
	{transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
	{transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
	{transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}
